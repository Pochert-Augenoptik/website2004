I want to build a brand website for my father's optometrician shop. We had someone design a homepage with Wordpress but I can't work with that. I'll provide you a screenshot of the website and I will also provide you the images used by it. 
The color palette is 
#00A99D
#004c81
#008C82
#1675bf
We want to only work on the homepage for now, don't worry about links. Also, don't pay attention to the text, focus on the design.
I want you to replicate that website from the screenshot as a static website.
